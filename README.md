# Password Generator


This is my first app using Spring Shell. 
For curiousity I wanted to start with Spring Shell by creating a simple side-project app and this is the idea I got. It's simple and hopefully efficient. 


## Features : 
- [ ] generate random password with a custom lengths
- [ ] choose characters to be included or excluded
- [ ] choose complexity requirements: number of uppercase, numbers, special characters...
- [ ] generate multiple passwords
- [ ] history of generated passwords
- [ ] save passwords to a file
